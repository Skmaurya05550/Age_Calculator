## Overview

This project is an **Age Calculator** that calculates the number of days, months, and years between a person's birthdate and a given date. It uses JavaScript to compute the difference and dynamically displays the result when the user clicks the "calculate" button.

## Files

1. **index.html**: The main HTML structure of the project.
2. **styles.css**: The CSS file that provides the styling, layout, and design of the calculator.
3. **script.js**: The JavaScript file that handles the logic of calculating the age and displaying the result on the page.

## Features

- **Date input**: Users can input a birthdate and a target date.
- **Age Calculation**: Calculates the person's age in terms of days, months, and years.
- **Responsive Design**: The calculator is styled using CSS for a modern, clean look.
- **Dynamic Results**: The age is calculated and displayed dynamically when the user clicks the "calculate" button.

## How It Works

1. The user selects a birthdate and a target date using the date input fields.
2. When the user clicks the **"calculate"** button, the JavaScript function computes the age in terms of years, months, and days.
3. The results are displayed on the page under the respective sections for days, months, and years.
4. The calculator is styled using CSS for an appealing user experience.

## Instructions

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter your **birthdate** in the first date field and a **target date** (the current date or any future/past date) in the second field.
3. Click the **"calculate"** button to view the calculated age in days, months, and years.
4. The results will appear below the input fields, showing the exact age difference between the two dates.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To structure the content of the calculator.
- **CSS**: For styling and making the calculator visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: To perform the age calculation based on the input dates and dynamically update the results.

## Customization

- **Modify Styles**: You can change the colors, fonts, or layout by editing the `styles.css` file to suit your preferences.
- **Enhance Functionality**: The `script.js` file can be extended to add more functionality, such as calculating the hours, minutes, or even seconds difference.

## Preview

The calculator consists of:
- **Two date inputs**: for selecting the birthdate and the target date.
- **Result fields**: which display the calculated age in terms of days, months, and years.
- **Calculate button**: which triggers the age calculation upon being clicked.
